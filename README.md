## ðŸ”§ Features

* Low-cost, accessible hardware (Raspberry Pi, LED array, filters, and Pi Camera)
* Pixel super-resolution algorithm for enhanced image quality
* Intuitive GUI applications for both Raspberry Pi and Windows
* Fully open-source software and 3D-printable hardware design

## ðŸ›  Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue**:
`ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`

**Solution**:
Install a compatible NumPy version:

```bash
sudo pip install numpy==1.26.4
```
