## üõ† Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue:**
`ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`

**Solution:**
Install a compatible NumPy version:

```bash
sudo pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

---

**Issue:**
Permission denied when saving files

**Solution:**
Run the application with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo python /path/to/OpenLM_RP.py
```

</p>

1. **Left Checkbox** ‚Äì Enable analysis of the captured hologram on a connected desktop.
2. **Middle Checkbox** ‚Äì Perform focusing directly on the Raspberry Pi. *(Note: Raspberry Pi 4B or above is recommended for reliable performance.)*
3. **Right Checkbox** ‚Äì Enable **real-time pixel super-resolution (PSR)**.

   > Requires the **"Client"** checkbox to be selected. This significantly reduces processing time during image capture.

</p>

5. **Current Time Display** ‚Äì Shows the timestamp of the image currently displayed.

   > This is especially useful when PSR processing takes longer than the image capture interval.
