sudo pip install rawpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install flask_socketio
sudo pip install imageio
sudo pip install scikit-image
sudo pip install image_registration
```

## üõ† Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue:**
`ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject`

**Solution:**
Install a compatible NumPy version:

```bash
sudo pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

---

**Issue:**
Permission denied when saving files

**Solution:**
Run the application with elevated privileges:

```bash
sudo python /path/to/OpenLM_RP.py
```

## üîó Mounting a Windows Shared Folder on Raspberry Pi

To access a Windows shared folder from your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
sudo apt install cifs-utils
mkdir ~/shared
sudo mount -t cifs //YourPCName/SharedFolder ~/shared -o username=YourWindowsUsername
```

1. **Left checkbox:** Select to analyze the captured hologram on a connected desktop.
2. **Middle checkbox:** Select to perform hologram focusing directly on the Raspberry Pi. (Raspberry Pi 4B or above can handle single hologram focusing but results are not guaranteed.)
3. **Right checkbox:** Select to enable real-time pixel super-resolution (PSR). Note: The "client" checkbox must be checked to use this option. Real-time PSR significantly reduces processing time for each capture event.
